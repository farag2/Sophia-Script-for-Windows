UNZIP all the files and import the `Sophia.ps1` preset file to import and to get the path for files to run. If you do not open `Sophia.ps1` then you can not run directly the PowerShell script you create (`Run PowerShell` button is disabled) and must run your script manually via PowerShell command line in console.
